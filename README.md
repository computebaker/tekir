### What Tekir is

Tekir is a fast, privacy‑first search experience that helps you find what you need across the web, images, and news—and also chat with an AI assistant called Karakulak. It doesn’t track you or collect personal data, keeping your searches private by design. Tekir aims to feel simple and snappy, with a clean interface that gets out of your way so you can focus on finding answers.

### Technical elements

- Next.js App Router + React 18 power a fast, minimal UI with progressive rendering, Suspense, and Turbopack for quick dev cycles.
- Convex is the real‑time backend: it stores users, settings, sessions, feedback, and analytics; React hooks (useQuery/useMutation) keep data live across tabs.
- Privacy-first auth: HttpOnly JWT with automatic refresh; server guards verify roles from Convex to enforce RBAC without exposing tokens to the client.
- Multi‑modal search is normalized behind uniform APIs, with request deduplication and sessionStorage caching (10‑minute TTL) for snappy repeats.
- Provider strategy uses Brave as primary with graceful fallbacks, while Dive blends AI answers with selected web sources for verifiable results.
- Karakulak (the built‑in AI) integrates multiple model backends via lightweight API routes and consistent caching/streaming behavior.
- Settings sync instantly via Convex subscriptions (no manual polling), and all search/AI usage aggregates stay privacy‑preserving and purgeable.
- Tailwind + Radix UI keep the interface lean and accessible; small SVG charts and CSV export provide data for the administrators.
